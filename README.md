# Space Defender

Space Defender is a space shooter modeled after the arcade games I grew up playing.  It is written in 2009 using C# without the use of a game engine.  The game was never completed, as the 3rd level (intended to be a boss level) was never programmed and the "mine" enemy time was never implemented (thought the code for it can be found in this source).  

This repository exists to serve only the prurpose of ensuring the code is available for educational purposes.
